# HSC Random Tools

## About The Project

HSC Random Tools is a personal project I built to help NSW HSC students better understand their performance and make more informed decisions. It includes tools like a scaled mark predictor, which estimates final HSC marks using past scaling data, and a Band 6 comparison tool that lets students explore how different schools have performed across subjects and years.

Current features:
* Scaled Mark Predictor
* Band 6 School List
* More Coming Soon!
